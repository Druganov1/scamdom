## About

Scamdom was created to explore how online gambling platforms operate while critiquing their often manipulative practices. This project simulates a functional casino environment, focusing on two games: **Roulette** and **Mines**, each with predetermined outcomes to highlight how such systems can be manipulated.

## Features

- Two fully functional games:
  - **Roulette**: A synchronized game where the outcome is predetermined and shared across all players in real-time.
  - **Mines**: A unique game for each player with outcomes predetermined upon starting the game.
- A fully functional realtime live chat system synced across every player.
- Built to showcase:
  - How outcomes can be manipulated behind the scenes.
  - The illusion of fairness in gambling systems.
- User-friendly design, emphasizing fun and educational value.
